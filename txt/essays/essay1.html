        <p>It isn't easy finding a project in the crypto space that will hold interest for longer than a few moments. The glut of pyramid schemes and useless tokens seems endless. The NFT space can seem unique or it can come off as a cash grab. Digging through the details is one of the only ways to find anything of quality, but that too can become a time sink without accomplishment or returns.</p>

        <p>Being exposed to Stevie's work can lead a person from the everyday modicum of reality down a winding path of laughter, surprise, and ultimately art. Sometimes the preconceived notion of what ""art"" is can be blurred through interactivity or through spontaneity. It's of this author's opinion that Stevie has done both. </p>

        <p>The first project that was encountered from this individual was the Subway Jesus Pamphlet project. Reading through some of the descriptions about the experience of taking the subway to work everyday evokes a vivid picture of Western existence. Endless people, yet potential for unrelenting solitude. Commuting leaves an individual with a daily ritual that can dictate ones experience throughout the routine. Reading the descriptions, it seems like the ""preacher"" became a fixture in the commute. An added bonus to this was the pamphlets. The desire to collect is born.</p>

        <p>Armed with these ideas, it became a game. Identifying which pamphlets connects with the user and which ones were unique are only the beginning. The process in which humans imbue value on objects can be a fascinating study. Perceived value changes from person to person, and from moment to moment within each person. The desire to archive and assign value becomes a feedback loop of validation and conquest. One could posit that the collecting of randomly generated NFT's is akin to the process of receiving a new Jesus Pamphlet. It seems that Stevie had a desire to share this process, because the pamphlets became available as NFT's. Religion and the need to prosthelytize has always been a topic of contention between cultures. Seeing this project recreate a monolith of religion as art in the NFT space is a unique and captivating experience. To top it off, a cathedral was erected in the metaverse to showcase the piety of the project. There was even a log book above the entrance. </p>

        <p>Understanding this supposition, it becomes clear that Stevie has a grasp on human psychology and art that few can draw a parallel to. Another example of this would be Fast Cash Money Plus. Some of the inherent concepts behind it are barely being explored in the NFT space today . The exposure to this project came from the pre release of the Art Block collection:Fake Internet Money. </p>

        <p>Users were given a link to the older project and told to find a discount code. The current value of a single Fast Cash Money Plus is ~40 eth. The reason for this is the value is pegged to a curve that accelerated as time passed on. In order to get a Fast Cash, users had to fill out arcane forms on an early dotcom style website that appeared to be transported through time and space. It felt like the crypto wallet was going to be infected with 56k connections. From there, Stevie had set up an input form and a login. Once the discount went live, users had to click on small moving boxes and fill out input forms in a race against others. If completed on time, the users received a single Fast Cash for .25 eth. Any user could redeem this Fast Cash for 1 Fake Internet Money. </p>

        <p>The idea behind using an old token from an innovative project to claim an Art Blocks project is creative and innovative. Once the Fake Internet Money released, it became clear that Stevie had a fixation on ""currency"". The designs and the style chosen for FIM are jaw dropping. After the reveal, Stevie unveiled many nuances in the project that the casual collector would overlook. Misprints, serial number patterns, miscoloration, silver notes, etc are all present in the collection. These details mimic the same issues any entity who issued physical currency would encounter and showcases the artists comprehensive understanding of the medium.</p>

        <p>It is never necessary to understand the modus operandi of an artist. However, through study it can yield a deeper connection to the art, the artist, and the surrounding world. Many of these concepts have been explored, but never have they been combined in this fashion.</p>
