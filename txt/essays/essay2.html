        <p>Experiencing Steven Pikelny's work is an exercise in breaking the mirage of the collective human experience to take a dive into the subconscious. Start with FastCashMoneyPlus. The moment the page loads, you're attacked by a mob of colorful bubbles, flashing lights, pop-ups, and dozens of font styles and sizes. It feels like a scam. And it makes little attempt to tell you convince you it's not. </p>

        <p>Only when you begin to navigate through the site do you notice how thoughtfully designed the site is. The illusion of a scam never gives up. Every click, every pop-up, every typo is choreographed to simultaneously make you want to go further into the rabbit hole and shut it down before a virus invades your device. Eventually, once your mind catches up with the absurdity of the site, you start to enjoy the comedy.</p>

        <p>The same thing happens with friendworld.social, fakebullshit.news, and ronamerch.co. Years of dealing with bad websites have trained me to look for many of the patterns Steven uses to present the absurdity of spammy digital content in its raw form. But curiosity is rewarded in Steven's sites. With a few clicks, the easter eggs become visible. Like the product reviews on ronamerch making political statements. Or the reply guys on friendworld.</p>

        <p>Then there's Subway Jesus Pamphlets. Steven took paper pamphlets he was handed in public spaces, took a photo of them, and sold them as NFTs. Most are now over 1Îž. No surprise. The layers of absurdity in these photos selling for thousands of dollars automatically makes them art. Steven took an object that we're all too familiar with, and displayed it under a new light. I always avoid people with pamphlets, especially those with political and religious messages. And now I'm carefully thinking whether the one with the gold pattern is more or less valuable than the one with the cartoons.</p>

        <p>It's only fitting that Fake Internet Money, which makes no attempt to hide what it's doing, be one the most aesthetically pleasing collections in Art Blocks. The elegance and symmetry of each piece are enough to make them alluring. But they also invite our subconscious to bare. At first glance the pieces feel familiar. We know money when we see it. Their value should already embedded into them. A closer inspection breaks the illusion. We remember they're art. We pay attention to the aesthetic details. Because art's value is subjective. Then we ask questions. Don't most currencies have beautiful details and stories to tell? Are they all art?</p>
