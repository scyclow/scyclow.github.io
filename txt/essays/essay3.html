            The Shimmer
          </h1>

        </div>
        <p>The first time I ran into the shimmer it was Sunday, and the dog and I were fifteen miles of fire road and 2 miles of foot trail into the middle of desolation. Legions of tourists flock to  Flagstaff every summer, and this year was not any different. It had been another protracted week serving these visitors food, zig-zagging  around them as they lumber in pods of five around the atrium. So, I popped over Cinder Hills  and into Hopi Land to hike the East side of the range. Only beleaguered locals visit this side, those whose souls sweat for the ardour and release found in desolation. We’d be lucky to meet another person on our hike. My body loose and my soul singing in anticipation for the solitude and silence. I could smell the dried grass and musty transition into fall. Off to the side of the trail I saw and then smelled the rock’s crater, a satisfying wet pucker in the brittle late september gold.</p>

        <p>The dog stopped suddenly, huffing, growling, hackles raised, haunches blistering in anticipation of someone, or something. “Lets go.” I said, a command she always obeys, and began lurching up the trail. She didn't budge, and the snorts, huffing and growling grew louder. I looked back at her in a mixture of frustration and concern, and that's when I saw it. The shimmer. Light refracted and bended, and suddenly my vision swirled, I was swallowed up by the kaleidoscope, until nothing. Black. Gone was the smell of autumn, gone was the autumn gold hills. Instead there was the taste of iron in my mouth, and something sharp and acrid flooded my nose. antiseptic.</p>

        <p>While I still could not discern my surroundings, I found that I was enveloped in a pool of light.  I was laying on something so soft I could not feel it. I tried to move my head to better see my position but, when I tried to move, neither my arms nor legs would respond to my command. I turned my attention to the white light. It seemed to have a gaseous consistency, as I spied tendrils slowly forming and dissipating into the air. I tried catching a feel with my hands and was surprised to find that the substance was gentle and supportive. With what felt like a herculean effort I shifted my gaze and panicked. I must have been 10 or 15 ft above the floor. I was floating. I instinctually flailed my body around, trying to cling to any support, however my limbs were still deaf to my panicked pleas. While I could certainly feel everything, I was paralyzed. I must have laid there in this state for hours, at least it felt like it, time was something that also began to feel unreliable. I eventually saw movement in my peripheral vision. A slender shape was approaching, seemingly human. As they approached they began to outstretch their arms. In fear I opened my mouth to scream, but nothing escaped my throat.</p>

        <p>What came next was a voice without a sound, "It is our intention to put you through a panel of experiments to better understand your morphophysiology. We already have a base understanding of your species  and while we have taken measures to ensure your safety, and hopefully comfort, should you feel any pain or discomfort, please speak out, and we will stop our experiments immediately. Do you understand?"</p>

        <p>I tried to move my lips - still nothing. I formed the words in my mind, "Yes". I felt silly, figured that I was just talking to myself, however almost immediately the alien responded, "Fantastic! Despite its simplicity, you have discovered a way to communicate with us. That is surprising," I heard the alien say. "We will now proceed."</p>
        <p>I felt a warmth of coursing through my veins, then a geyser of energy, and my heart rate increased. Beads of sweat formed on my brow. This continued for several minutes with my heart beating faster and faster until, at last, it began to slow down.  The voice returned, “Very good, we have now attuned our instruments to your particular chemistry.” I managed to gulp down a breath of air and for the first time picked out whispers and murmings in the shadows. It struck me then that I was being watched, that  cloaked in the shadows was a crowd. </p>

        <p>“Now there still is the matter of your psychology” Nervous in anticipation of what may come next my breathing became more shallow and panicked. “Do not fear, no harm will come of this, in fact you may experience pleasure in untangling the knots of thought and hidden desires” I told myself that nothing so far had been painful, and tried to nod in consent, despite my head not budging, the feeling must have been conveyed for a moment later my vision blurred. I blinked, and tried to bring the picture back into focus. I was greeted to a feast of technicolor hallucinations, or at least that's what they must have been, divine geometrics, pyramids crowned with piercing eyes, fantastic images flew by too quick for me to make sense of, but I had the feeling that I, or at least my semi-consciousness, was hurtling towards something - an idea waiting on the horizon, cresting over hills of pure light. I felt giddy, agitated, and anxious, and then...stillness. A  spirographic gossamer began to creep into my peripheral vision until I beheld something so fantastic, that it was fitting for the dreams of the god-king. My entire being felt electric and alive, and I was convinced I could take on any challenge. If my muscles had allowed it, I know my face would have been beaming with confidence. My mind was filled with the thought that I was the luckiest man in the world. Just as I glimpsed divinity, the visions ended, and I was thrust back to the pool of white and the shadowed amphitheater.</p>

        <p>My body glistened  - a sheen of perspiration covered it. The alien reached for what looked to be a sponge and gently dabbed at my face.  "Thank you," I thought in my head. "Of course," said the creature. "As we stated from the onset - we mean you no harm.”</p>

        <p>The alien turned back to its audience, I surmised that it was communicating with the larger group and I thought I picked out enthusiastic murmurs of approval. I had a sense that, however pleased they were with how these  experiments were, they were expecting something more. </p>

        <p>"We are very pleased with your physical and mental responses. Be assured that you have provided us wit an even better understanding of how human bodily systems function under various conditions. Wiith verification by your body during tonight's tests, we are now ready to try this new drug on a human for the first time. As I have stated before, you will suffer no permanent harm. Although we cannot be sure of your full reaction, if the drug acts on your physical systems as we suspect, you should enjoy this portion of the experiment very much. Furthermore should you wish to continue you will be properly compensated.”</p>

        <p>I waited for the familiar warm feeling in my veins. I was still coming down off of whatever the last drug was. I could tell I was still somewhat under the influence of the last drug that had entered my system and felt surprisingly happy. Gradually, I noticed a tingling pleasure start to envelop me. As the waves of pleasure pulsed, it began to localize around my groin. It felt as if I was being caressed by millions upon millions of tiny fingers, not just on the outside of my body, but inside too -- right down to my inner core. Suddenly, without any sense of control, my cock began to come alive. There was nothing I could do to stop it.. I was aroused to such a degree that, instead of being embarrassed because I was so intimately on display, the fact I was being watched by an unknown number of eyes added tremendously to my excitement. At that moment, I didn't care if the entire world was watching me naked with a raging hard-on.</p>
        <p>I watched as the alien uncurled tubing connected a small machine the shape of a mason jar. As two of its tentacles stroked my inner thighs, another reached to secure a flexible cylinder over my cock. The cylinder seated itself tightly and began gently to suck and pulse. I was reminded of the best blowjob I'd ever had. Inside the pulsing cylinder, I felt unexpected pressure on my urethral opening. Tubing was being inserted into my penis! I could feel the insertion as it made its way inside the length of my cock and bumped into the sphincter at the base of my prostate. The cylinder and the urethral insert began to work in tandem, alternating back and forth in a spectacular sucking and pulsing torment of pleasure for my cock.</p>

        <p>I was swiftly reaching my breaking point. Physically, I was nearly at my limit. Mentally, I had been stimulated to a level of arousal beyond belief. What else could they possibly do to my body!? My swollen ball sack felt like it was going to explode. My cock was being expertly sucked by some spectacular alien milking machine, and the drugs coursing through my veins were causing unimaginable pleasure signals in my brain.</p>
        <p>"Now you will be allowed release," I heard the alien voice say. Instantaneously, I felt my entire body engulfed by orgasm. Cum spurted into the cylinder with such force. Copious amounts of white, gooey, sperm made their way through the tubing and into the cylinder. It felt as if it would never stop. My body convulsed with pleasure so intense that I would have screamed out loud if I could. I was amazed as I saw the container on the machine fill with my fluid. And still my orgasm continued. The first container was removed and a second took its place. The alien milker was extracting more cum from me than was humanly possible.​​The last drops of cum oozed from my cock into the machine, and I lapsed into a deep and blissful sleep.</p>
        <p>When I awoke, I was fully dressed and reclining in the air. I could move my body, but there was nowhere to go. I felt refreshed and rested. I was weightless and floating in the same room, but now it was dimly lit and empty. Then I watched as the alien approached me, and I heard, "If you would like, we will clean your memory. We do not want you to have any ongoing stress from this experience. However, if you choose, you may remember it all. You have helped us very much - more than you can possibly know. Our species utilizes human semen in many medical treatments for disease on our home planet.</p>
        <p>I responded, "Please let me keep my memory. I can't imagine not being able to look back on this time. Thank you for being so kind. Although, I do need to say that you have probably ruined me for any type of normal human sex from here on out. Nothing is ever going to compare." After what I hoped the alien could tell was some mental laughter, I paused. Then, I made one final decision. "Could I possibly ask for a favor from you?"</p>
        <p>"Of course!" said the alien. "We would be happy to grant you any reasonable request."</p>
        <p>Soon I was back in my pickup, driving home in the early light of morning. I pulled out my wallet and smiled, a rainbow hued bill stood out from the rest of the notes. My smile grew even wider as I pulled it out, it was an “IOU”. I knew I would see the aliens again.</p>
