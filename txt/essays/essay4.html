            She Was a High School Drop Out
          </h1>
          <h4>by <a href="https://twitter.com/wrensnft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wrens</a></h4>
        </div>
        <p>She was a highschool drop out. One of those sleazy cheerleaders who seduced a teacher and got him fired, ruined his life. She got expelled. She was sent to a boarding school in south eastern Conneticut. It was a school of nuns. They wanted to make sure there were no more men around that could be wooed by her charms. </p>

        <p>Her name was Jezebel Molenaar and when she graduated from boarding school. She joined the military. She had a lust for power, because of course, she never had it, except maybe when she was in bed with a man. Little did she know that the military was a refuge for the powerless. She was young and naive then. But after her service she was smarter. Wiser. OIder. </p>

        <p>When she left the army, a part time boyfriend recommended she join the Secret Service. She thought that meant she’d be protecting the President or something. But the friend explained that the secret service also does other stuff too. </p>

        <p>So she visited the office, took the tests, filled out the piles of paperwork and thought she’d never hear from them again. </p>

        <p>But she did. </p>

        <p>And so Jezebel became a secret service agent.</p>

        <p>And she liked it. </p>

        <p>Her boss was a strong willed woman named LeVonna Cortwright. LeVonna could sense the drive and ambition in a fellow woman and so she took Jezebel under her wing. </p>

        <p>LeVonna put her in the office of Counterfeit Investigations. It was an elite group within the service where you not only had to use your brains behind a desk but you often had to go out and get dirty in the field. </p>

        <p>And that’s what Jezebel loved to do. Get dirty in the field. </p>

        <p>Jezebel had flown far to visit a mysterious man she had only spoken with on the phone, and exchanged a few emails with. Or so LeVonna and the rest of her office thought. </p>

        <p>The truth is, she found this suspect months ago. She got tangled up in his web of lies and contorted up in his beautiful body. she fell in love with the suspect. </p>

        <p>He was a programmer named Stevie who had started making digital currency he was pawning off as fake internet money. </p>

        <p>But it was as real as Jezebel’s cheerleading pom poms. And sometimes just as colorful. </p>

        <p>He was using this fake currency to buy her things. Jet skis, a trip to the Cayman Islands, a wedding ring from a Detroit pawn shop that was connected to organized crime. </p>

        <p>Like so many times in Jezebel’s life, she was in over her head. And she liked it. </p>

        <p>She had just made love to him again. It was one of those hour long sessions that only the two of them could endure. A rush of pleasure that was more like a workout than a love making session. </p>

        <p>But then again, Jezebel loved her Zumba classes.</p>

        <p>“I gotta go.” Jezebel Said. </p>

        <p>“You just got here.” It was more of a question than a statement. Stevie was the one in control but his pillow talk syntax was that of a hopeless romantic. </p>

        <p>And Jezebel ate it up like the never ending breadsticks at Olive Garden. She loved Olive Garden. Her mother was from Italy too. </p>

        <p>“The office called me five times and I’m nervous they suspect something.” She said. </p>

        <p>“Just call them from here.” Begged Stevie. </p>

        <p>She hated calling the office when Stevie was in bed with her, it made her nervous. </p>

        <p>“No, I don’t like to do that.” She said. </p>

        <p>“Why not?” He asked. </p>

        <p>“Because I’m supposed to be arresting you, not making love to you.” She fired back. </p>

        <p>“Arresting me?”</p>

        <p>They went over this a thousand times. </p>

        <p>She tried explaining it again. “You make fake internet money, you can’t make fake currency, my job is to go after people that make fake currency.”  She slipped a nude colored scrunchie onto her ponytail.</p>

        <p>Stevie tried to explain. “But I call it fake internet money, it’s a joke?” </p>

        <p>“Money’s not a joke Stevie, it’s illegal.” </p>

        <p>She wasn’t so sure she wasn’t going to arrest him.</p>

        <p>“Okay, okay, let’s not talk about this stuff anymore, here—“ He reached for her phone. </p>

        <p>Put on some Kenny G and I’ll go down on you. </p>

        <p>“No, I’m not in the mood, I gotta go”  She put the rest of her clothes on and started out the door. </p>

        <p>“Can I call you?”  He asked, as if they hadn’t gone through this tired charade a dozen times before. </p>

        <p>“I don’t know.” She stammered. “I don’t know.” </p>

        <p>She turned around and headed for the 1997 Saturn he bought her for when she visited. She loved that car, even though it was old, it was inconspicuous. But also, Stevie lied and told her Luke Perry used to own it, because she loved Luke Perry, and he knew she’d never be petty enough to check the chain of ownership to prove him wrong. </p>

        <p>“Goodbye” He said with the finality of the final seconds of a microwave that’s over cooking a pepperoni hot pocket. </p>

        <p>“Goodbye.” She said. And Jezebel walked out the door, into the shadows, where the darkness meets the coldness, and where the ends can turn into beginnings again. </p>
