          <h5><strong>Volume 1</strong></h5>
          <p>Steve didn't know why he was crying. He couldn't remember much of anything, except for the woman who had appeared out of nowhere. She had long, dark hair and deep blue eyes. Her skin was very pale, almost white, and she was stunningly beautiful.</p>

          <p>Steve looked around. He was in a strange room. It was a lot like a storage unit, but everything was so shiny and bright. He had a funny feeling in his gut. The walls were made of metal, and there were several strange devices scattered around the room. There were large screens, which Steve thought must have been monitors, and oddly shaped containers.</p>

          <p>Steve's clothes were gone. He was naked, except for a small diaper. Steve tried to move, but he was stuck in a cold metal chair. He was very scared.</p>

          <p>The woman walked over to him. She was carrying something Steve had never seen before. It looked like a gun, except that there was no barrel. She pointed it at Steve. A blue light shot out of the end of the device. Steve cried out as his body went numb. He couldn't move.</p>

          <p>The woman walked over to Steve. She smiled at him, but it didn't make him feel any better. She caressed his face, and he became aware of the fact that he was very aroused. "Please don't hurt me," Steve said, his voice cracking.</p>

          <p>The woman smiled. She bent down and whispered in his ear. "I won't hurt you, Steve. We just need you."</p>

          <p>Steve felt himself becoming more aroused. He wanted her. He wanted her to touch him. He had never felt like this before. He had never felt so helpless, so vulnerable. The woman walked back over to the table. She picked up what looked like a needle, except that it was very large.</p>

          <p>"Please don't hurt me!" Steve cried.</p>

          <p>The woman smiled. She gently caressed Steve's face. "I won't hurt you, Steve. I just need you."</p>

          <p>Steve looked into her deep blue eyes. He felt himself begin to relax. The woman smiled, and she slid the needle into his neck. Steve began to cry, but he felt good, too. The woman pulled the needle out, and she wrapped her arms around him. Steve cried into her hair. He was safe. He felt very safe.</p>

          <p>The woman held him for a long time. Steve's crying stopped, and she began to stroke his hair. He liked that. It felt nice.</p>

          <p>Steve looked up at her. She was very beautiful. "What's your name?" he asked.</p>

          <p>The woman smiled. She leaned down and kissed him. "My name is Alexa."</p>

          <p>Steve smiled. "That's a nice name."</p>

          <p>Alexa smiled back. She bent down and whispered in Steve's ear. "I know."</p>

          <p>She straddled his lap. She was very warm. Steve could feel her pressing against him. Alexa began to kiss him, and Steve felt himself becoming more aroused. Alexa smiled yet again. She slipped her hand under his waistband. "You're going to love this, Steve."</p>

          <p>Steve felt her hand slide inside his diaper. He felt himself becoming more aroused. He moaned. "I don't know what you mean."</p>

          <p>Alexa squeezed his balls. "You will, Steve."</p>

          <p>Steve's moaning continued. Alexa pulled his diaper down. Steve looked down at his manhood. Alexa stroked his shaft, and he became fully erect. "Good boy," she said with another smile.</p>

          <p>Alexa began to jack him off. Steve couldn't scream. He couldn't move. He couldn't do anything except moan. It felt good. It felt so good. Steve began to cry again. Alexa smiled at him and kept jacking him off. She whispered in his ear. "Your seed will make us strong, Steve."</p>

          <p>Steve began to squirm. Alexa kept stroking him. His cock felt like it would explode. Alexa smiled at him and whispered in his ear once more. "Good boy."</p>

          <p>Steve cried out as Alexa jacked him off. His cock exploded, and he began to cum. Alexa kept stroking him until he was completely empty. She smiled at him. "You did good, Steve."</p>

          <p>Alexa lifted her fingers to her lips. She sucked Steve's cum off her fingers. She smiled and winked at him. Steve felt very aroused. Alexa gently wiped Steve off and put his diaper back on. She kissed him again and whispered in his ear. "You were very good, Steve. Your seed will make us strong, Steve."</p>

          <p>Alexa rubbed her face against Steve's and then she slipped out of his lap. She moved to the back of the room. She pulled a strange looking metal container from a shelf and moved back over to Steve's chair. She opened the container and pulled out several metal instruments. Alexa put one of the metal things down on the table. "This won't hurt, Steve."</p>

          <p>Steve watched her. He didn't know what she was doing, but he felt very safe. Alexa moved one of the the strange instruments over to Steve's lap. It was warm and it felt good. Alexa smiled and whispered in his ear. "Good boy."</p>

          <p>Steve moaned as Alexa slid the strange device under his diaper and into his ass. "Why do you need my seed?" Steve started to become slightly worried again.</p>

          <p>Alexa smiled. She stood up and walked over to him. She caressed his cock. "We need your seed, Steve. You're going to make us strong, Steve."</p>

          <p>Steve felt himself becoming aroused again, despite his recent release. His cock began to harden. Alexa caressed it back and forth. "You're going to make us strong, Steve."</p>

          <p>Alexa smiled and whispered in his ear. "You want to make us strong, don't you, Steve?"</p>

          <p>Steve nodded. "Yes." Steve twisted his head around and saw himself on the monitors around the room. He saw Alexa stroking him. He saw the instrument in his ass. He saw the strange metal containers. "What's going to happen to me?"</p>

          <p>Alexa looked up at the monitors. "Let's show you what we're going to do to you."</p>

          <p>Steve watched as Alexa opened the metal container. There were little metal eggs inside. She broke one of the eggs open and poured some of the liquid inside down the front of Steve's chest. Steve felt the warm liquid slide down his chest, onto his stomach, under his diaper, and through to his cock. Alexa put the lid back on the metal container and pulled the strange device out of Steve's ass.</p>

          <p>Steve looked down at his lap, and he realized that the strange liquid had hardened. It was now a metallic looking sheet formed around the curves of his chest and shaft. Alexa moved behind him, and she pulled Steve's arms behind him and restrained his wrists. She did the same with his ankles. Alexa walked around in front of him slowly lowering Steve's wet diaper. She took a deep breath and lowered herself onto Steve's lap.</p>

          <p>Alexa's pussy engulfed his cock. She was very warm. Alexa began to ride him. She kept whispering in his ear. "Good boy."</p>

          <p>Steve couldn't hear anything except for Alexa's voice. She began to ride him faster and faster. Steve cried out as Alexa's pussy tightened around him. He could feel himself becoming more aroused. His cock ached. Alexa began to squirm. She gripped Steve's shoulders. She dug her nails into his now metallic chest.</p>

          <p>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Steve shouted as Alexa's pussy convulsed around his cock. Her juices flowed over him. Steve began to orgasm himself. Alexa's velvet walls squeezed his now metallic shaft. Steve watched on the monitors as the strange looking metal sheet formed harder around his tortured vessel.</p>

          <p>Alexa rode Steve slowly now. She caressed his face. "Good boy, Steve. "I won't hurt you, Steve. We just need you." Steve's cock began to loosen. Alexa slid off of him.</p>

          <p>Steve was confused. What had happened? Why did Alexa need his seed? What had she done to him? The questions ran through Steve's mind, but he could do nothing but watch as Alexa walked over to the large computer in the corner of the room. She tapped a few keys on the keyboard and pressed several buttons. A section of the wall opposite from where Steve was sitting opened up.</p>

          <p>Steve tried to move, but he couldn't. Alexa moved over to him and caressed his face again. "You're going to like this, Steve."</p>

          <p>Alexa took her time walking back over to the computer. She looked at Steve, smiled one last time, and pressed another button on the keyboard. The room began to fill with a strange gas. Steve began to feel light headed. Alexa walked over to him and kissed him on the forehead. "Good boy."</p>

          <p>Steve couldn't move as Alexa walked back over to the computer and pushed another button. Steve's body felt warm, and then he drifted off into darkness...</p>

          <h5><strong>Volume 2</strong></h5>

          <p>On the day that Edward Snowden disappeared, I had been chasing a story in Texas. It wasn't a big one, but the possibility of getting a juicy exclusive on the mysterious disappearance of a former government employee meant my boss was willing to dish out some serious cash for the rights. I'd been struggling to get anywhere when monsoon season hit, and the last flight back to New York was canceled. After a thoroughly uneventful night at the motel bar where I'd been holed up for the last three nights, I decided it was time for a change of scenery. I had just settled into bed with a bottle of tequila and the latest issue of Playboy when I heard an odd noise outside. It was the sound of my motel room door slamming against the wall. I instinctively reached for my notepad, ready to jot down anything that might be worth writing down, but slowly my neck relaxed as I realized what had just happened.</p>

          <p>Three gorgeous-looking people were staring at me.</p>

          <p>If they were human, I would have been concerned about what was going to happen next. But I could tell from the pale skin and their sharp, beautiful features that these were the same little green men from the old sci-fi stories I'd been so obsessed with as a child. They were naked, their pearly cocks in full display.</p>

          <p>Momentarily I worried that I had fallen asleep while drunk and was having some sort of bizarre wet dream. But when the green man with shaggy hair started speaking I knew this wasn't a fantasy.</p>

          <p>"You are Kate Harper," a deep, almost achingly sexy voice said.</p>

          <p>"I am," I muttered, still not quite believing my situation. "And you're obviously aliens."</p>

          <p>They laughed in unison. Alexa, the beautiful green woman who had been standing closest to me stepped forward and reached out a hand. "My name is Alexa," she said.</p>

          <p>I took her hand, and it was almost as if a jolt of electricity had just shot through me. "Where did you come from?" I asked.</p>

          <p>"We live on a distant planet," Alexa explained. "The land of the Free."</p>

          <p>"And what do you need with me?" I asked.</p>

          <p>Alexa reached out her hand again, only this time she intertwined her fingers with mine. A powerful jolt of lust ran through me, my vagina almost instantly dripping wet. She's so beautiful, I thought to myself. This whole situation is so surreal.</p>

          <p>"We need your help," Alexa said. "You help us, and we will reward you with the ultimate orgasm."</p>

          <p>I looked at her in disbelief. "These words are crazy," I stammered. "What is an orgasm?"</p>

          <p>It was the tall, titanic green man who walked forward the few steps it took to stand in front of me. "Not an orgasm," he corrected her. "The orgasm." His semi-erect cock hung so close to my face I was able to smell the heady scent of his green-skin.</p>

          <p>"Oh my god," I stammered. "You're fucking gross."</p>

          <p>I was about to stand up, make a run for it, when Alexa grabbed my hand again. "Stay with us," she said firmly. "We will show you the orgasm."</p>

          <p>"Show me," I said, not believing that the words were actually coming out of my mouth. "Yes."</p>

          <p>Alexa and her companions had me naked in a matter of moments. I didn't even try to resist, afraid that they'd do something to me if I did. A few seconds later Alexa tossed a small blanket onto my lap. "This will keep your clothing from getting wet," she said.</p>

          <p>"Wet?" I asked. "It's not wet now."</p>

          <p>Alexa walked towards me so that her face was level with mine. I could smell her musky, alien scent again. "Do you want to know what it feels like to have an orgasm?" she asked.</p>

          <p>"I think I want that," I said, looking at the amazing green girl who was inches from my face. A few seconds later Alexa slowly lowered her face towards me, and our lips met. She was soft, her body yielding to mine. It wasn't long before I could tell Alexa was kissing me back, while her alien companions circled around us. I felt like I was in a dream, but that dream wasn't about to stop.</p>

          <p>Alexa took the blanket and draped it over my head, blocking out the rest of the room. She kissed me for several moments longer before she pulled away, letting her hand travel all over my body. She cupped my breasts, pinched my hard nipples between her alien fingers, then led one finger down to my vagina. I gasped as she pushed a finger inside me. Then she quickly pushed two more in.</p>

          <p>THE END</p>
