        <p>I missed the FIM mint. After seeing the outputs, I remember pulling open my laptop in the middle of the Columbus, Ohio where I was visiting from London for Capital Camp, and rushing to buy secondary from my phone’s hotspot. There was something deeply amusing about the fact that I was at a finance/tech conference, and stopped in the middle of the street to buy “Fake Internet Money”. In my rush, I very nearly bought “fake” Fake Internet Money on OpenSea, and chuckled at how ironic it would be if I bought fake FIM … would that make it all real? </p>

        <p>Value is a collective myth. I love how FIM leaned into this concept from the outset with the pyramid scheme ethos of its early distribution, playing on the reality that everything is a pyramid scheme … until it isn’t. While we grasp for foundational anchors of value, the tides can just as swiftly change overnight, and it’s almost better to start unmoored entirely, with a foundational layer of value that is so overtly valueless, that perhaps it will represent the underpinnings of some more stable base.</p>

        <p>One of the most incredible things in watching the growth of defi and algorithmic stablecoins has been the concept of value collateralized by belief collateralized by belief. Once you pass the third derivative of expectation, something funny happens to the brain. It loses the ability to disentangle reality from fiction, and somehow the fiction becomes reality. And in that recursion, is there a hint of some permanent reality or is it all just weight that will collapse unto itself? </p>

        <p>Maybe it’s all just art, not science. Maybe it’s all just … Fake Internet Money. And that is as real as anything in this crazy world. </p>
