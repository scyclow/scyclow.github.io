        <p>"All rise," the judge exclaimed. My defendant, Stevie, and I both stood up. He had been accused of embezzlement of state funds along with serious counts of tax avoidance and is now facing the prospect of five lengthy years in prison. Stevie is a notable character in society, a self-made political figure who has yearned for the approval of those around him and succeeded in that endeavour. I was particularly anxious when I initially received the offer to defend him in public court, given that when things go awry in public court and prominent figures do not get their desired outcome, dark consequences generally ensue. Yet, I was given an offer I simply could not refuse on account of my personal circumstances, it was almost as though they knew my exact current predicaments. Coincidence?</p>

         <p>As the judge proclaimed, I began to lose focus. I started feeling localised warmth emanating from my right arm. It was uncomfortable, but not unbearable and almost felt foreign. I grabbed at it, accidentally touching Stevie in the process and instantly glanced at him, our eyes locked. Stevie was a handsome man with dark brown eyes and a chiseled masculine jaw. He was wearing an immaculately tailored suit contoured perfectly around his masculine shoulders and tightly hugging his waist, with his shirt skin tight against his broad chest.</p>

        <p>The way Stevie stared at me was intimidating, his bright eyes were different this time, they were filled with fire and I could feel that bothersome heat on my arm again, it was an eerie sensation.</p>

        <p>"... after carefully reviewing the evidence and statements presented to this honorable court, you have been found guilty as charged, I sentence you to 5 years of imprisonment and a bail set at 350,000,000 Fast Cash" the judge announced and with that, he grabbed his wooden gavel and slammed it down, punctuating the ending of the trial and formalising Stevie’s fate.</p>
        <p>I swallowed hard, all of a sudden, Stevie grabbed my arm with tightly and I immediately looked at him again. "You cost me my freedom, don’t think this’ll be the last time you see me," he growled.</p>

        <p>My lip started shaking, "are you going to kill me?" I asked him, in the same low voice , in the hope that no one would hear.</p>

         <p>"I wouldn't let such a fine woman go to waste," he said with a wicked smile that for some unbeknownst reason, increased that peculiar foreign sensation on the right side of my body, "but you're going to lose your freedoms too"</p>

        <p>Soon after, a police officer came over to cuff him and take him away. My heart was rushing, skipping beats and I started to feel my hands become sweaty. I began to place my documents inside my suitcase and left as fast as I could, something felt incredibly off deep within.</p>

         <p>I ran through the labyrinthian courthouse, past endless rooms and perplexed guards eventually bursting out of the main entrance through the double doors and into the parking lot. I threw my suitcase inside my car and immediately started the engine. I drove at full speed as the exogenous heat within me began to intensify and spread. I couldn't understand the sensation, but I felt as though I didn’t need to.I heard stories of those in the past who have felt this burning sensation, they often descend into insanity with some of them claiming that they soon after begin to hear outside voices. I didn’t give it much thought as they are constantly labelled as insane conspiracy theorists by the News Source.</p>

        <p>I finally reached my office after opening the door and getting out of my car. As I enter the building I notice everyone in my office switch their attention towards me. Why is everyone staring at me, or am I just paranoid? I walk past the open floor towards my corner office. As I do so, I feel each pair of eyes tracking my every move, I almost feel naked.  I am slowly losing my privacy, I thought. I run inside and lock myself in my office in an attempt to escape the madness.</p>

         <p>Dropping to my chair, I exhaled and opened the buttons of my blouse, I was starting to sweat. I then looked at my computer, the self facing camera is oddly more visible than usual and its LED is flashing green. I hadn't noticed that before. Suddenly, I heard a sniggering laugh. I turned to see if someone was there, then I moved the mouse of my computer but nothing was on, still, I could hear it, laughing. It must be in my head?</p>

        <p>My stomach fluttered with nervous butterflies, "touch your nipples," the voice echoed. The voice was somewhat familiar, but I couldn't pinpoint the owner. Was it in my head somehow? Or emanating from my computer?</p>

        <p>I started feeling my nipples hardening beneath my bra, and then, without noticing, I took my hand over my breath and slid it inside my blouse, reaching for my nipple. I heard the voice laughing again, "you're my puppet, you'll do whatever I say, I’m following you and watching you"</p>

        <p>That was the confirmation, it was clearly Stevie and he was undoubtedly in my head speaking to me telepathically. I looked around in my office for confirmation, there was no one other than me in this room. My breath caught in my chest as I unbutton my white shirt and reach for my ample bosom. My flesh felt hot and heavy under my hand as I cupped my breasts, in an effort to appease Stevie, before continuing to move my hand to my nipples, caressing them instantly sent shivers down my spine.</p>

        <p>By now, the initial burning sensation I felt in the courtroom has spread throughout my core. Oddly enough, I began enjoying myself with the added thrill of Stevie observing me. "touch yourself, let me see you in all your glory", Stevie goaded. He had me where he wanted, and I wasn't going to fight back. His face was imprinted in my memory with vivid detail almost as though his presence was in the room. Our gazes locked as I lay there exposed.</p>

         <p>"You can't hide your feelings for me, touch yourself, remove your lace”. His voice was soft and deep, the tone firm. I was being commanded, not asked. A perverse thrill shot through me, and I shivered. I was in Stevie’s world now and I knew it. His eyes followed my hands as I slowly peeled the scrap of black lace down my thighs. His projection moved closer to me as I ran my hand up my calf, raising goose bumps on my skin. I moaned as I grasped my panties, jerking them down the rest of the way. I slipped my feet from them and spread my legs on my desk, exposing myself to him.</p>

        <p>“Don’t stop,” he said, watching me intently. I spread my legs a little, and he ordered, “Wider”. I heard my pulse in my ears as I parted my thighs further. Then, placing my index above my covered slit, I felt the wetness of the fabric. I was scared, but also aroused. I began feeling a tingling sensation in my hands, like electric jolts, it felt almost as though someone was controlling what my hands were doing to me. I began to circle my clit, stroking myself and letting my fingers wander further, dipping inside before tracing upward again, coated in the evidence of my overwhelming desire. I smoothed the silky wetness over my clitoris, into the short, neatly trimmed strip of hair on my mound.</p>

        <p>Wordlessly, Stevie watched me rub my clit in slow circles. Being like this for him, my legs open, my pussy exposed and gleaming wet while his projection stood there spiked my arousal even higher despite the uncertainty of the predicament I was in.</p>
 "I know you like it, you can't hide your feelings from me."

         <p>I moaned as my index circled and spread my wetness around. Suddenly, I felt the tingling sensation in my arms as my fingers crawled down my wet slit. Rubbing against my entrance, my index and middle finger slowly slid inside my tender region, rubbing my walls which made me moan louder.</p>

         <p>My legs began to shake as the warmth in my core intensified further. My fingers rubbed my inner walls in the right spots. "Stevie, stop, please!" I moaned, but a huge part of me wanted to continue. My thighs tensed, and I planted my white heels firmly against the carpet. My orgasm wound tight within me, ready to spring and uncoil me. A yelped, “Ah!” of frustration escaped, and I lifted my hips from my office chair. I was going to come, I was so close, I was going to come while he watched me, without him ever touching me, and I was so goddamn close —</p>

        <p>“Stop.”</p>

        <p>I couldn't take it anymore, my fingers slid out of my pussy one final time, taking me to the very edge of satisfaction. "Stevie!" I moaned loudly. I felt my toes curling up and my walls clenching around my fingers. My whole body quivered and quaked as the delicious sensation slowly faded, "You're my slave, everyone will know you're mine," the voice repeated to me as I recovered from the precipice of a transcendental orgasm, never in my 30 years have I felt something as strong as this, yet I didn't even finish. The frustration from not climaxing was only alleviated because deep down I knew that this affair with Stevie is far from over. Was I an accomplice for playing along? Am I no longer a victim?</p>

         <p>Days pass after that incident without hearing from Stevie explicitly, but I can feel his presence persisting within me through that same indescribable burning sensation I felt during that fateful day in the courthouse. On some days Stevie's voice echoes ever so slightly in the background, bubbling latently under the surface. I can feel him agitating for attention in my dreams, looking for help in some form, but I’m unsure why he couldn’t just contact me as before. Could he have lost his Jesuit, Divine powers? Are his telepathic powers related to proximity or physical presence? Nonetheless our encounter has made me yearn for his masculine energy and thick, adonis belt between my thighs.</p>

        <p>I decided to visit Stevie to reach some closure. I set up a conjugal visit at the CGK Federal prison where Stevie was being harboured. Given his influence on the ruling class the visit was surprisingly easy to organise. I suppose I am living in Stevie’s universe. I just wasn't aware of the breadth of his reach.</p>

        <p>I was led to a small trailer within the grounds by a couple of officers, I sat down on the bed waiting nervously for Stevie to enter with my eyes fixated intently on the door. A few moments later, Stevie enters wearing an orange jumpsuit, characteristically tailored around his chiseled physique. I jump up, impulsively hugging him and almost instantly feel his member growing as I caress it gently.</p>

        <p>My eyes connected with his, and at that moment in time, I knew I was his target, and always have been from the very beginning. For all the sway he held, he was guilty and had been caught in flagrante delicto with the crimes he was charged with, I had very little chance of acquitting him of his charges and he knew it.  "I knew you would come back," he whispered in his deep voice. He explained that the whole court trial had been one last request from him to the Gods to get closer to me.</p>

        <p> I wanted to demand an explanation, but before I opened my mouth I began feeling that same burning sensation rousing within me. I locked eyes with Stevie once more as he smiled at me and purred “I owe you one for coming back to me, you won’t regret this”.</p>
