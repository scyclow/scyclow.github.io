        <p>Things you find on the floor can lead to interesting things</p>

        <p>It’s nearing the end of my shift and I couldn’t wait to leave my desk as soon as possible. I am currently trying to finish a task assigned to me by my manager as fast as I can so that I am able to log off from my office computer and head straight for the exit. It’s not that I dislike my job, but who doesn’t want to get out of work early? I work as a copywriter for a small marketing company here in Montreal, and it’s not really the most exciting career out there. It’s quite boring. Actually, my life has been quite boring and uneventful. The thought of my failures has been keeping me up all night and stressing me out. I am constantly going about my day with little to no energy. It’s surprising that I still manage to keep my job which pretty much pays for my cost of living, as well as my leisures. I guess the only thing I can consider an achievement for myself is that I haven’t lived with my parents since graduating college. For someone like me, that’s a lot. But enough about that.</p>

        <p>I am now exiting my work building and make my way to the subway station. As I am walking my vision slowly starts to blur and I hear a weird ringing noise in my ear. I try and look for a place where I can sit and just wait until I get back to normal. I would imagine this was caused by my tiredness, but it’s weird because I don’t feel tired at all and I know when I feel tired. I sit on some steps and just wait. My vision is slowly getting clearer and the noise is starting to become recognizable. “MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY…” echoes into my ear getting clearer and clearer by the second. Then suddenly, it stops. My hearing is back to normal and I am able to see my surroundings enough for me to continue walking. I stand up, look down at the ground and find this unique looking bill that I am stepping on. I found it quite unique and it didn’t look like it was just printed on some normal piece of paper. In fact, it looks and feels like real money. It’s obviously not a Canadian bill that’s for sure. I thought it was obviously from another country and because I was hearing the word money beating like a drum in my ears 2 seconds ago, I decide to keep it. I also really liked the design, from the border to the patterns found throughout the bill. I know that different forms of currency are unique in their own way but where is this even from?</p>

        <p>A few days had gone by and I’ve been noticing more bills that resembled the one I had picked up off the ground previously. I thought it was some random graphic design trend that gone viral but no one seems to know about it anytime I mention it to them. I even tried to ask the pretty coworker that sits right next to me about her opinion on it. I sometimes fantasize about us caressing each other, her undressing me, me undressing her, us fondling each other more passionately, her climbing on top of me , her riding my hard stick and then finishing with me finishing inside her. All of this on top of our desk while our coworkers watch us perform the act. My sexual fantasies is often a reminder that I have fallen under a dry spell for a long time. Anyways, when I ask if anyone had found similar paper money, no one had seem to see any. Am I the only one that can see them? I must be hallucinating all this. First the situation that happened the other day and now this. I must be losing my mind. The work day ends and I prepare to leave my desk. But before I go, I try to say bye to my desk neighbour without being nervous.</p>

        <p>Today has been really rough. People at the office must’ve thought I was out of it since I’ve been pestering everyone about the money I’ve been finding. For some reason, the thought of people not taking me seriously really affects my mood in a negative way. I decide to go to a bar around where I live and have a couple beers to let loose a bit. It was a Friday so the inside was pretty packed but I managed to find myself a seat. Across the bar, I notice a very attractive young lady. I couldn’t really tell how attractive she was because it was dark and I’ve downed 4 bottles already. She approaches me, which was surprising, and decides to strike a conversation with me.</p>
        <p>“Hey, I see that you’re alone. Mind if I join you?”.</p>
        <p>“Sure”, I say, “you aren’t with anyone either?”</p>
        <p>“No, I’m actually new in town. I live around the corner and this bar seemed like a nice place to wind down after work”</p>
        <p>“My god”, I thought to myself. I was right, this girl was a bombshell and she decided to talk to me? We might even be able to see each other pretty often if I keep the ball rolling. The idle chat continued throughout the night and with a couple more drinks in me I found it easier to talk.</p>
        <p>“Hey, I’ve been noticing these weird bills around the city lately. No one else seems to see them anywhere and people at work seem to think that I’m crazy because I’ve been collecting random notes I find of the floor.” I drunkenly say.</p>
        <p>She looks at me weird and tells me “That’s odd, I haven’t seen any at all since I’ve been here”</p>
        <p>I continued on about the notes and this seemed to bore her to death. To her, it probably seems like I’m one of those conspiracy theorists that have seen a UFO and is trying to convince people that aliens do exists but always come up short when asked about proof. She came up with the excuse that she had to go to the bathroom but then never returned. I later see her talking with another man so I decide that I should soon leave. I’ve already had enough drinks so that was no point in me staying longer. The conversation started out nice and I haven’t talked with a female in this setting for such a long time so it gave me high hopes.</p>

        <p>        As I stand up, a random man asks me about the bills I’ve been finding. I show them to him and his eyes glimmer with glee.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, but do you know what these are? I seem to be the only ones finding them”</p>
        <p>“I sure do, they’re ℱ@kĘ money.”</p>
        <p>I couldn’t decipher the word he said before money but I ask him “from where you come from? I’ve never seen this money anywhere”</p>
        <p>“Indeed, because I am not from here.”</p>
        <p>“From here? Where are you from?”</p>
        <p>“Outside of earth.”</p>
        <p>“An alien?”</p>
        <p>“Yes”</p>
        <p>This guy must be playing a prank on me. I tell him sorry, I don’t have time for his act and I leave the bar. What a weird night.</p>

        <p>The next day, the man I had met last night appears in front of my building. I pass by the back of my building in order to avoid him but my plan failed as he managed to spot me.</p>
        <p>“What do you want?” I ask.</p>
        <p>“ ℱ@kĘ money, ℱ@kĘ money, ℱ@kĘ money”, the manner in which he said this reminded me of the voices echoing in my ear a couple days ago.</p>
        <p>“What?”, I say.</p>
        <p>“I need you to find ℱ@kĘ money so I can leave with my ship.”</p>
        <p>“Here he goes again with this alien bullshit from last night”, I thought to myself.</p>
        <p>“This isn’t some alien bullshit”, I shockingly hear in my head.</p>
        <p>Wait a minute, what was that voice? I am certain that his mouth didn’t move at all. It seemed like he was conveying a message to me telepathically.</p>
        <p>“Yes.”, he communicates.</p>
        <p>“So were you the one sending me that message a couple days ago? Why’d you also make me partially lose my vision?” “Sorry that was an accident, I meant to send an alert message to my home planet but I guess you seemed to pick up the signal and it affected your vision somehow.”</p>
        <p>“So what’s the deal with this money and why am I the only one able to see them?”</p>
        <p>“Well you aren’t the only one. I am able to see them as well. In fact everyone in my species can. You being able to see them must be the effect of the signal I sent out and you being able to receive it.”</p>
        <p>“What’s the deal with this money then?”</p>
        <p>“Actually those aren’t money. My species, ℱ@kĘ money, are shapeshifters and we revert to that form when we have no energy left. I was assigned to turn into whatever species our ship falls into in case everyone gets spread out.”</p>
        <p>“And here I thought these could be used to buy things”</p>
        <p>“Actually, in exchange of finding them, I will owe you something of any value. But you also need to enter their data on a special machine.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean?” I ask as he hands me a cellphone looking thing.</p>
        <p>“Here, take this. Once you find one of my comrades, enter then pin number that’s found on them. This will transport them onto the ship right away and will give you IOU points.”</p>
        <p>It feels like I’m in a dream and I am reluctant to help but the fact that I can wish for anything pretty much seals the deal. He tells me that there are 10 to be found on earth and that I have already found 4. With those four IOUs that I’ve already gained, I use it in the most pathetic way possible. My first wish is to have a redo with the girl I met at the bar and make her forget about the first conversation we had. It worked out well because one thing led to another and we’ve been fucking every few days throughout the week. I also wished for sexual work fantasy to come true and it did. That was probably the wildest thing to ask for.  We both obviously got fired for indecent exposure and hit with a lawsuit by my employer. I obviously wished that away and also wished for the most imaginable amount of cash. So I no longer need to work, nor find a job. I was living my best sexual life and life in general. A few weeks had gone by and I’ve already found all 10 of the ℱ@kĘ money. I used up all my wishes on other superficial desires with no regrets. Someone else might’ve used it for good, but I don’t care.</p>

        <p>On the day that the ship was set out to leave, I suddenly found myself inside of it. Unbeknownst to me, by agreeing to help out, I must help find all the lost ℱ@kĘ money throughout the galaxy. I fells like I’ve just accepted a “terms and agreement” to my life without actually reading it. There was nothing I can do about since I’m already on board the ship and already found myself in space. I forgot to mention that this ship doesn’t fly at all. It teleports to coordinate inputs. This was probably why I didn’t hear about a crash landing on the news. Anyways, we’re already far away from earth. I sink into a degenerate state and build a harem in every planet we visit using my wishes. I’ve always had a fascination for alien porn anyways.</p>
