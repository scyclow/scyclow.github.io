            What am I Doing?
          </h1>
          <h4>by Anonymous (with the help of GPT-3)</h4>
        </div>
          <p>What am I Doing?</p>
          <p>How did I become someone who hands out pamphlets on the Subway? I can't say that I remember the details of how it all unfolded as it is still hazy, but one day, there I was standing on the corner of 42nd street and 8th avenue with a handful of pamphlets. I don't know why I do it.  Maybe it's because I'm afraid that this is real, or maybe it's because I need to believe it is real.</p>

          <p>What I Remember:</p>
          <p>It was the year of our lord two thousand and sixteen, and I had just gone off the grid.  I had been living in the woods for a couple of years and my wife and I were doing just fine.</p>

          <p>I had set up a small home out of a shipping container and had built myself a solar power system to keep my phone charged.  I didn't have much, but I was happy.  My phone could sometimes connect to the internet. It was all I needed at the time.</p>

          <p>One day, I read my first article on fakebullshit.news. Then I read another. And another. Before I knew it, I was reading them all. I was hooked. I would sit in the woods and read them all day. </p>

          <p>I had to talk about them with someone. I had to share the information. I got a friendworld.social account and started posting. I even started writing my own articles. I had to get the word out. I had to get people thinking. </p>

          <p>Then, I Started to See It.</p>
          <p>I was lying in my bed, reading one of the articles, when I heard a strange sound.  My wife was next to me sleeping; I initially thought it was her.</p>

          <p>I rolled over and looked at her.  She was sleeping peacefully.  I turned back to my phone and started to read again when I heard it again.  This time, I knew it wasn't my wife.  </p>

          <p>I got up and went outside.  I was in a field of grass.  Even though it was the middle of the night, the sky was blue and the sun was shining. I felt good. I felt like I could be anything. Then it happened, the sky turned black and the clouds rolled in. There were flashes of light, like lightning, but they kept on coming, and coming, and coming until it formed a layered weaving of light in the sky.  Then, I looked up and there were two giant eyes staring down at me. They were red and angry. I tried to run but I couldn't move, it was like I was paralyzed. The eyes opened up and a giant mouth appeared. It swallowed me whole.</p>
          <p>The next thing I remember is waking up in a dark room. I was strapped to a table, my arms and legs tied down. There were bright lights shining down on me and I felt like I couldn't breathe. The triangular mouth I saw in the clouds opened up and it started to swallow me whole again.</p>
          <p>There was a bright flash and I woke up in my bed. I was covered in sweat and my heart was beating like crazy. I looked over and saw my wife sleeping next to me. Was it all a dream?</p>
          <p>I looked over at the clock and it was 4:33 AM. I got up and went to the bathroom to get a drink of water. It was then that I noticed something on my face. It was a giant, red, circular mark. I went to the mirror and looked at it. I started to panic. It was an eye, an eye just like the ones I saw in my dream.</p>
          <p>I got the hell out of there and went back to bed. I looked over at my wife and she looked peaceful.  She heard me stirring and asked me what was wrong. I couldn't answer her, I just started crying. Then, she opened her eyes and looked at me. They were red and angry. Then everything got hazy and I woke up again at noon.  </p>
          <p>I was no longer content with my frugal isolated life.  I needed answers.</p>

          <p>Social Support.</p>
          <p>I pulled up friendworld.social to share what had happened. I created a post on my page: </p>

          <p>"I had a strange dream last night. It was terrifying. I saw a giant red eye staring at me, then it opened up and swallowed me whole. Then I woke up and there was a giant mark on my face that looked like an eye! What does this mean? " </p>

          <p>I got a notification that I had gotten a comment on my post. It was from someone I didn't know. It said: "You saw the eye of CryptoGodKing, and you were swallowed by the beast. You are one of us now, and we will never let you go."</p>

          <p>That night, I got several comments:</p>

          <ul>
            <li># posted by   Anonymous : 8:35 PM on friendworld.social : I have had dreams like that. They are so vivid it is hard to tell the difference between reality and imagination.</li>
            <li># posted by   Anonymous : 8:36 PM on friendworld.social : Maybe you were abducted by aliens?</li>
            <li># posted by   Anonymous : 8:39 PM on friendworld.social : Maybe you are an alien</li>
            <li># posted by   Anonymous : 8:40 PM on friendworld.social : I doubt it. I don't think aliens come from other planets. I think they come from the ocean.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I was glad to hear I wasn’t alone, but I couldn’t read any more of the comments on my friendworld.social posting.  I needed to know what actually happened. </p>
          <p>I searched and searched and found the website I had been looking for. I clicked on the link, and a new page popped up.</p>
          <p>"Welcome to The Truth Is Out There." it read. I scrolled down and saw a video.  I clicked on it and started to watch. It was a man in his early twenties, he had shaggy brown hair and glasses. He was wearing a black t-shirt with the words "I Want To Believe" in white lettering.  He started to speak:</p>
          <p>"Hello, my name is James and I am an alien abductee. I was taken from my bed at night and experimented on by aliens. They took me to their spaceship and did all sorts of things to me. I was swallowed by a triangular mouth with a red circular eye and was returned to my house, but I was marked with the eye.” </p>
          <p>“I am here today to tell you that if you have seen these eye marks on your body, you are not alone. There are others like me. I was taken and experimented on and I know what they did to me. If you have seen the eye of The CryptoGodKing,”</p>
          <p>I was shocked. I had never heard of this website before, but it was exactly what I was looking for. I quickly filled out the form</p>
          <p>I gave them my contact information and a detailed account of my experience, and then I submitted the form. I was surprised to see a response so quickly. I opened the email and read it carefully.</p>
          <p>"Thank you for submitting your alien abduction experience to The Truth Is Out There. You have been selected to be part of our ongoing experiment. We will contact you soon for an interview.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>The Truth Is Out There"</p>
          <p>"Wow," I thought. "I'm finally going to get some answers."  With a sigh of relief, I was able to go to bed.</p>

          <p>But, Was it a Dream?</p>
          <p>That night I woke up to a female alien standing over me. She had a long, thin face, and her eyes were huge. She was wearing some sort of silver body suit.  She said she was going to take me to her leader, CryptoGodKing.  </p>

          <p>It took less than a minute to get to her spaceship. It was huge, with several levels. The inside was dark, and the walls were covered in strange concentric symbols. She carried me to a small room, and then she left. I sat there for several minutes.   A voice emanated from the ship:</p>
          <p>"I am the CryptoGodKing. This is my spaceship. You can ask me for answers, or for one dream to come true. You can also ask me for one thing to be changed. I will grant you one of these things, but you must choose wisely."</p>
          <p>I thought about it for a minute. I had no idea what was happening to me, and I needed answers. "I want answers," I said. </p>
          <p>"The truth is out there," he said. "I will show you the truth."</p>
          <p>I felt a sharp pain. Then, everything went black. I woke up back in my bed. It was morning, and I had a slight headache.</p>
          <p>I had no idea what this meant, but I knew that I had to tell someone. I went to my friendworld.social account, and I posted a new story</p>
          <p>Topic: Is this real life?</p>
          <p>"I had another strange dream last night. It was the same as the one I had before, but this time I was taken to an alien spaceship. The CryptoGodKing told me that if I wanted answers, he would show them to me.  </p>
          Then, everything went black and when I woke up, I was back in my bed.
          <p>I don't know what this means, but I am going to keep you posted.</p>
          <p>I got a notification that someone had commented on my story:</p>

          <ul>
            <li># posted by  Anonymous : 8:46 AM on friendworld.social : Maybe you are a time traveler?</li>
            <li># posted by  Anonymous : 8:47 AM on friendworld.social : I don't think that's it. Maybe you have been visited by an alien from the future, and it has altered your DNA to make you a time traveler?</li>
            <li># posted by Anonymous : 8:48 AM on friendworld.social : Maybe you are a clone of yourself from the future, and you have come back in time to stop an alien invasion of Earth?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I couldn't read anymore comments. I needed to take action.  I sent another message to "The Truth is Out There":</p>
          <p>"I want to know what CryptoGodKing’s truth is. Will you investigate this?"</p>
          <p>I got a response:</p>
          <p>"We will do our best to find out what we can about CryptoGodKing. We will contact you soon."</p>
          <p>I was relieved. Maybe this website could actually help me figure out what was happening to me.</p>

          <p>The Path to the Truth?</p>
          <p>I woke up at 4:33 AM in a bright white room full of alien women. They were all wearing silver suits, and they had long faces and huge eyes. They were standing around me, staring at me. They asked me what I wanted to do to them. I said words that sounded like gibberish.  I tried to explain what I meant, but it was hard to do without words. One of the alien women touched my forehead, and then everything went black.</p>
          <p>When I woke up again, I was erect and fully inserted into one of the alien's wet pussies. She was moaning, and she was moving her hips back and forth. I felt like I was in a dream. I pulled my dick out of her pussy, and then I shoved it into one of the other alien's pussies. She moaned louder than the first one. I fucked one of the alien's pussies, and then I fucked the other one. Then, they both started moaning at the same time. I pulled my dick out of their pussies, and I looked down at it. It was covered in a strange green liquid. I looked at the alien women, and they were all staring at me. I smiled, and then I passed out. </p>
          <p>I woke up back in my bed, with a slight headache. It was morning, and I had no idea what had happened.  My wife was sleeping peacefully as if I had been there all night.</p>
          <p>I logged back into to my friendworld.social account, and I found that I had received a message:</p>
          <p>Topic: Truth is out there?</p>
          <p>" When an alien and a human have sex, the alien's green liquid enters the human's bloodstream. The human fucks the alien for a few minutes, and then the human passes out."</p>
          <p>I was shocked. I had no idea what to do with this information.  I sat in my bed for a few minutes, thinking about what I had just read.  The green liquid.  The alien women.  The fucking.</p>
          <p>I heard my wife stirring in the next room, so I got up and went to make her breakfast.  I was still thinking about the message on friendworld.social .  </p>
          <p>"What if it's true?" I thought.  "What if it's really true?" I went back to my computer and logged back into my friendworld.social account.  There were several messages in the topic: </p>
          <p>Topic: Truth is out there? " If you have sex with an alien, you will pass out. When you wake up, you will feel as though you were dreaming." </p>
          <p>" If you have sex with an alien, your penis will be covered in a strange green liquid. The alien's pussy will also be covered in the green liquid."</p>
          <p>I started to wonder, what do they mean that the green fluid enters the bloodstream?  Am I going to be OK?  Is this going to change me? I sent a message to "The Truth is Out There":</p>
          <p>"What happens after the green liquid enters the human's bloodstream?"</p>
          <p>I waited for a response, but I never got one. </p>
          <p>I went to my friendworld.social account, and I posted:</p>
          <p>Topic: Truth is out there?  Erotic Alien Abduction Story:  The truth is out there, but no one wants to tell me what it is. I have asked them to investigate alien abductions and to tell me what happens after the green liquid enters the human's bloodstream, but they didn't respond.</p>
          <p>I went to bed a wreck that night.</p>
          <p>Physical Changes.</p>
          <p>I woke up at 4:33 AM in a bright white room full of alien women. They were all wearing silver suits, and they had long faces and huge eyes. They were standing around me, staring at me.  </p>
          <p>I walked up to one of them and smiled at her. She smiled back at me, and then she grabbed my erect dick. She led me to a nearby corridor, and then she pushed me against the wall. She started to kiss me, and then she pulled down her silver suit. Her pussy was wet and glistening in the moonlight.</p>
          <p>I shoved my dick into her pussy, and she moaned. She started to moan louder and louder, and then I felt a strange sensation. My dick was getting bigger, and it was growing in length and girth. </p>
          <p>I pulled my dick out of her pussy, and I looked at it. It was covered in a strange green liquid. I looked at the alien woman, and she was staring at me with wide eyes.</p>
          <p>I smiled at her, and then I passed out.</p>
          <p>I woke up back in my bed, with a slight headache. It was morning, and I had no idea what had happened.</p>
          <p>I went to my friendworld.social account, and I found that I had received a message:</p>
          <p>Topic: Truth is out there?  "I have investigated your story, and it seems to be true. After the green liquid enters the human's bloodstream, the human's erect dick grows in length and girth. The human fucks the alien for a few minutes, and then the human passes out."</p>
          <p>Have I been talking to aliens this whole time?  I logged out of my friendworld.social account and went to the bathroom. I took a shower, and then I looked at myself in the mirror. My dick was huge. I had never seen my dick so big before.</p>

          <p>The Truth?</p>
          <p>I couldn’t walk.  I couldn’t let my wife see me like this.  I sat down, locked the bathroom door, and sent a message to "The Truth is Out There": </p>
          <p>"I know you are the aliens, I still don’t understand what is happening and I want the truth." </p>
          <p>I waited for a few minutes, but I got no response. </p>
          <p>I logged back into my friendworld.social account, and I found another message: </p>
          <p>Topic: Truth is out there? "Yes, you have been talking to aliens this whole time. The green liquid is prosperity. Those who retain faith shall be led by an invisible hand towards a higher plane of wealth. Those who do not retain faith shall be led by an invisible hand towards a higher plane of poverty. Faith is necessary for wealth, and it is also necessary for health. If you choose to retain faith, I will help you become wealthy and healthy. If you choose to lose faith, I will help you become poor and sick. I will guide your hand, and you will be led towards a higher plane of existence."</p>
          <p>I felt a tingling in my head again and then I was back in the white room with the aliens. They told me that they were satisfied with my performance and that I could go now. They gave me a white coat, put me in a car and drove me to the edge of the forest. </p>
          <p>Then I saw a large storm cloud appear with lightning striking across the sky. From the cloud emerged the vision of CryptoGodKing.  It was looking at me.  I could feel the gaze of the eye upon me.  I tried to move, but I couldn't.  I tried to look away, but I couldn't.  Then the eye spoke. "You have passed our tests.  You have been chosen to spread the word.  Your blood has been infused with the green liquid of faith and prosperity, but if you loose faith it will sour and turn into sickness and poverty."  It said.  "You will be given the tools to share our message.   You will be given the truth." </p>
          <p>The sky turned the landscape pitch black.  When the light returned, I was standing in front of a large, metal door. It opened and a man walked out. He looked at me and said here are some pamphlets.  Spread the faith.  "Good morning." </p>

          <p>The Next Day.</p>
          <p>I woke up with aches all over my body.  My wife was standing over me, asking if I was okay.  I told her I was fine, but that I had to get to work.   I had to get the word out.  I started to hand out pamphlets at the subway station.  At first, it was hard, but not for long.  I was given the tools I needed.</p>
