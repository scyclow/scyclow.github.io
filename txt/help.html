      <p>Dear Mr Paget,</p>

      <p>I found you through project camelot and felt the need to get in touch. I don't know who to talk to because no one will take me seriously. I've experienced several visits over the course of the last seven years, with increasing frequency. As an experiencer, i've undergone a tremendous amount of stress as a result of these experiences. I was wondering if you had any therapeutic recommendations. It would mean the world to me.</p>

      <p>Dear Mr Paget,</p>

      <p>It's hard for me to recall all my experiences in perfect detail because there have been so many of them, but I'll do my best. And thank you so much for listening to what I have to say. It's been a struggle, to say the least, to get people to hear me out.</p>

      <p>It started around the spring of 2011 in upstate New York, I don't remember the first sighting, but throughout the season I noticed several strange aircrafts during the day time. They looked like black triangles, but were usually moving too fast for me to get a good look at them. I just brushed it off. I thought maybe they were birds or satellites or something. But, I saw them so often that I knew something strange was going on.  By the summer, I was seeing them close to daily -- and not just during the day! Occasionally at night I would see a bright translucent blur in the sky for a split second, and then it would be gone. Sometimes I would even see up to five of them at a time. It was hard to get a good look at them because the sightings would last a maximum of 2 or 3 seconds.</p>

      <p>The weird thing was that this was only happening when I was looking! Even if I was with other people, I was always the only person to see them. My friends just laughed it off and told me I was drunk. It was around that time that I started to experience very strange "dreams" -- In the middle of the night I would feel as though I were in a large metallic room. My mouth tasted heavily of copper, and I felt a definite Presence. My body always felt like it was falling in these dreams, similar to how you feel when you're in free-fall in an airplane or rollercoaster. </p>

      <p>The frequency of these dreams fluctuated, but some time during the mid-winter of 2012 they stopped entirely, as did the sightings. I then went another several months with no Experiences or Sightings of any sort. But then on the summer solstice of that year that changed. I was driving in my car that night and listening to the radio, when waves of static started overtaking the signal. I didn't think much of it, until I heard some sort of aircraft overhead. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it sounded too low. I looked out the window and saw three bright pink lights beaming at me. That's all I remember. I woke up the next morning with my car in a ditch. I wasn't seriously hurt, but I had a pretty nasty nose bleed and a loud ringing in my left ear. No one believed me about the experience, and my insurance wouldn't cover the car repairs because they assumed I was driving drunk. But I was stone cold sober when this happened! I had to pay for the repairs out of my own pocket. I really tried hard to figure out what happened, but my friends thought I was totally nuts whenever I talked about it. I also remember going to the doctor about my ear (which continues to bother me to this day due to the high pitched ringing) a couple weeks later. He said nothing was wrong with me. </p>

      <p>I don't know what happened that night, but it kicked off a whole new wave of sightings and strange "dreams", lasting through late 2013. One "dream" in particular stuck with me because I felt as though I was awake for the entirety of it. I was lying in bed when my naked body began floating and passing through all solid matter. I was terrified, but whenever I tried to move I was paralyzed. When my body was outside the house, I saw that i was being pulled towards a bright pink-organge light. (This all happend fairly quickly, by the way. Although my body felt no acceleration, I later estimated that I was pulled up maybe 300 feet in a matter of 5 or 6 seconds). </p>

      <p>Now, you'll have to bear with me, because I'm not really sure how to explain what happened next. I'm not sure if my memory was blurred out, or if the experience was too abstract for my brain to comprehend, but I'll do my best: After I hit the light I was surrounded by total pitch black, and all I could hear was the ringing in my ear. I felt a very strong Presence, even though I couldn't see anything. I also felt totally disembodied, but had a sense that all of my body parts were separating -- skin expanding and organs unravelling with my skelaton staying intact. But soon each bone started to separate at the joint. Even though I felt absolutely no physical pain, I was completely terrified. I felt like I was being disected, if that makes any sense. </p>

      <p>I woke up the next morning naked on top of my beddings, with my empty pajamas underneath in the sheets. I've never walked in my sleep, and have no memory of taking my pajamas off in the middle of the night, let alone placing them under my beddings. It's possible that this was partially, mostly, or entirely a hallucination, but it stll seems very strange. In any case, that day I remember being very nausious with a severe migraine headache. </p>

      <p>I won't go into every single experience, but the fragments I was able to piece together all involved being abducted (I hate to use that word, but it's the most descriptive), having my body disassembled, then having my body reassembled, and waking up the next day with intense nausia, a splitting head ache, and a metalic/copper taste stuck in my mouth. (For whatever reason, I found that eating very salty foods helped mitigate these effects). If the experiences and the immediate aftermath weren't bad enough, the after effects usually lingered throughout the rest of the week, and significantly impacted my day-to-day life. I had a lot of trouble concentrating at work, and as a result cycled through several jobs. I also was not able (and am still not able) to be part of any sort of healthy relationship. It's hard to get close to someone when you know they won't believe you about something this important. </p>

      <p>This all continued up until last year, with the weird "dreams" occuring roughly once every two months. During this time I actively stopped looking for strange aircrafts, and convinced myself that this wasn't happening. I just told myself that they were bad dreams. And for whatever reason, all future experiences allowed me to continue living out the fantasy that nothing was wrong. I'm not sure why I haven't had any more experiences like the car accident -- otherwise I'd have some solid evidence. I wish I took detailed notes about the experiences instead of blocking them out, because it's really hard to keep all my thoughts straight when I'm going entirely off my memories. It's hard for me to remember hard dates, or the order of certain events.</p>

      <p>But one thing I can say for certain is that my mental state has been consistently deteriorating. The "dreams" started occurring less frequently through last year, but I've felt my thoughts becoming increaingly scrambled. Sometimes it feels like my brain is having two or three conversations at the same time, and it's really hard to keep track of what's what. These lines of thought are usually totally nonsensical, so I don't really know how to verbalize them. Some of these conversations seem to be coming from other people's heads. Other times, it feels like someone else's thoughts are being broadcast into my head. It's worse when I'm in crowded spaces. I'll hear things that (supposedly) don't exist, and all the conversations in my head go rapid fire. As a result, I've tried to keep to myself as much as possible.</p>

      <p>Throughout all this, I at least felt thankful that I hadn't had any more "dreams", but that changed a couple weeks ago. It was the first experience I've had in nearly a year. It might not sound very interesting, but I woke up in the middle of the night with a sharp awareness that I was not alone in the room. There was a definite Presence -- in fact, it may have been the strongest I've ever felt. I didn't see anything unusual, but the center of gravity of the room felt "off", if that makes any sense. And while I didn't hear anything (aside from that infuriating ringing) I felt like something was telling me that I was gonig to die soon. I don't know if whatever was in the room with me was telling me that, or if that's just how my brain interpreted it, but it scared the hell out of me. </p>

      <p>This latest experience shocked me out of my denial and convinced my that I needed to find help. Oddly enough, my thoughts have felt much more lucid after that event. Maybe They adjusted something, or maybe the fear just straightened out the chemicals in my brain. But in any case, I've just started to conduct research on the Internet about this. Although, I haven't read many other accounts yet. I've come up with a lot of theories about what's been going on, but nothing coherent. Maybe it's aliens/UFOs? Maybe it's the government? Maybe it's God? Maybe I'm just going crazy? I don't know. I was hoping that, as a specialist, you might be able to tell me if my experiences line up with anything else you've heard. I'm really grasping at straws here, so any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>

      <p>Looking to your response,
      <br>Steven

    <div class="email-content">
      <p>Thank you Steven,</p>

      <p>That is a very full and coherent account. You are 100% sane. I have heard and interviewed similar cases to yours, either in total or parts of what you have experienced. You will find testimony to these in my books listed below which may give you some perspective on your situation.</p>

      <p>In summary I will be brief of my interpretation of your account.</p>

      <p>1) The US Government made a deal back in the early 1950's to allow certain entities to 'abduct' (borrow) 250,000 of their citizens on an ongoing basis to allow these entities to conduct medical experiments and genetically improve their (claimed) dying race. This number over the decades has increased a great deal. There could be 4 to 5 millions souls who have experienced this now and it is ongoing.</p>

      <p>The deal required the 'aliens' to report the numbers back to the US Government. They quickly broke this requirement and numbers are unknown.</p>

      <p>2) The purpose of these operations is to harvest gene stock from the human race to produce 'hybrids',clones and I have to say in some instances food as enzymes extracted from bodies. In 95% of cases the abductees are 'unharmed' but many suffer psychological stress as the memories of the events are erased, obscured or buried in their brains by the advanced mental controls used by the alien entities. There are more than one group doing this and many alien groups are neutral or benign to the human race so don't 'tar them all with the same brush.</p>

      <p>2)  The ringing in the ear is because you have been 'chipped'. This is a homing nano device which allows hem to find you and monitor you. They can read your thoughts as they will read this communication here and they can induce thoughts and emotions in you. If you 'know' that this is occurring you can identify it and manage it by knowing it is not from you and you can command back as it is always a two way traffic. Don't be aggressive even if frustrated but be in command of yourself as your letter indicates you have a very good mind. They respect you by using you so often. You are 'good stock' which they farm like a farmer looking after their sheep. </p>

      <p>If you read through my books you will find similar cases. They are on Amazon as listed below.</p>

      <p>Now here is my best advice. Oh! By the way this has made you more psychic so you are picking up other peoples thoughts. Just switch off those that do not apply although it can be helpful. And try putting thoughts (nice ones) into other people around you specifically and see if they pop out with the item in their conversation (two way traffic as I said).</p>

      <p>Now if you want to stop or reduce this activity be aware New York State is one of the 'hot spots' for the alien activity. They have territories and the 'deal' applies to all US territory both home and overseas. So MOVE. Definitely from where you are now. Could be overseas. Get a US passport. Research it. Don't just move to a US overseas location. Make sure you can work and settle there. If in doubt ask my advice on territories over which they have control in this respect. They tend to have Earth located bases and work locally. Why travel further than need be?</p>

      <p>3) In the mean time psychically clean the house and your thoughts. Chuck out anything related to the occurrence. Change out the car that got damaged, they will have marked it for relocation.  Scrap any clothes that are related to the events, they will be contaminated. This is routine advice. </p>

      <p>4) When aware of their presence transmit back. Set parameters, ask questions, receive their thoughts, give respect, but demand respect back. IF encountering 'small greys' know they are bio robots and must accept commands. View an old film: "Forbidden Planet". Re. Robby the Robot. THIS is the 'Forbidden Planet'.</p>

      <p>5) You will get no help or understanding from any public authorities - they are either ignorant or impotent to act or just suppress it. Doctors will just think you are mad as the society is programmed to think this does not exists. The top government people in ALL countries know about it but just keep quiet as they can do nothing about it. Trump knows about it as have some former Presidents but not all. See the latter books of mine for lists. </p>

      <p>6) Be aware you are in some ways modified and special. You can take advantage of this and use it as you will have picked up certain attributes from these experiences. If it does not freak you out be aware that your sperm would have sired children on other realms. You have kids you may never see. It is test tube technology, I doubt it involved 'sex' as such.</p>

      <p>Be aware your 'soul' likely has an off world origin also and that may distance you somewhat from the ignorance of human beings at this time. They have been kept in the dark for centuries I assure you. Does a farmer give his sheep math lessons?</p>

      <p>7) All for now and a lot to take in but that is the bottom line and the ball is in your curt. Read some books, clean out the junk from your past life and research plans for a new future. If you don't then these events tend to go on throughout the persons life which is the general rule I observe.</p>

      <p>Trust this is helpful.</p>

      <p>P.  </p>

      <p>Wow, that certainly *is* a lot to take in. I'm not sure where to start. I definitely suspected some of these things, but it's pretty shocking to hear it coming from an expert like yourself. How many other people do you think know about what's going on? 4 - 5 million Americans is a lot of people! Why don't they talk about it out in the open? How could the politicians be so crooked as to let this continue going on? Why did the government even make a deal with Them in the first place? What did they get out of it?</p>

      <p>I've had so many thoughts about this since reading your last email, I'm not sure where to start. And I'm reluctant to ask you certain things if They can read this communication... but I'm sure they've heard my thoughts about it by now, so maybe it doesn't matter? Anyhow, I guess my first question would be: Why me? What's so special about me? I'm pretty average, and there are plenty of guys like me walking around. I don't understand what makes me such "good stock".</p>

      <p>How do I get the chip out? This ringing is really annoying. Since I first read your email I've attempted to communicate with Them through my thoughts and ask them to stop, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. If anything, the last week or so has been particularly bad. Do you know of any exercises I can do to get better at communicating? Or, is there something I can do to be more clear?</p>

      <p>I wish I could move, but I'm really strapped for cash right now. I'm sort of between jobs at the moment. As I said in my last message, I've been having trouble holding something down for an extended period of time. As a result, I'm living day-to-day on any cash I can scrape together. I'm not even sure I even have enough to get one of your books (which is really unfortunate, because they look really interesting and helpful). So, I think moving is off the table for the near future. But longer term, are Canada and Mexico part of the deal? That would be easiest for me. I was also wondering: If I got a job in the embassy of a foreign country, would they have to ignore me during working hours? If so, which embassies? Are there any other safe zones inside the country?</p>

      <p>Anyhow, I really really appreciate the response. It hasn't all been pleasant to hear, but I think I'm finally set on the right track. Thank you.</p>

      <p>Your good Friend,
      <br>Steven
