            The Block

          <h2><a href="https://twitter.com/steviepxyz/status/1628238813825847301" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">âž¡ Twitter thread</a></h2>
        </div>

        <p>Earlier this week, someone claiming to be <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@fintechfrank</a> from The Block reached out to me on discord to write about my "project". I was skeptical since I have multiple projects and the message was poorly worded. But I decided to give Frank the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/1.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/2.png" >
        </div>

        <p>I tried to answer his questions as efficiently as possible. We decided to schedule a call, but not before I joined their discord to create an 'author request ticket'. But I was excited for my article in The Block, so I wanted to talk ASAP.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/3.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/4.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/5.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/6.png" >
        </div>

        <p>With the call postponed, I decided to join their discord. Its verification bot directed me to the very trustworthy looking url of botmee6.re, which had a pretty standard verification step of dragging a button into my bookmark bar.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/7.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/8.png" >
        </div>

        <p>The URL for this link attempted to run some JavaScript. This was too complicated for me, so I got frustrated and didn't do it.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/9.png" >
        </div>

        <p>A couple days later, <a href="https://twitter.com/daleybish" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">daleybish</a> reached out to me about my article! I was really excited since the Editor and Chief of Staff of such an important publication were reaching out. I tried to answer her question in as much depth as possible but she insisted I make a ticket in discord.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/10.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/11.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/12.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/13.png" >
        </div>

        <p>We tried troubleshooting. She hopped on a call with me to help, but her mic wasn't working. Eventually I got frustrated and decided to follow up with Frank to see if he wanted to just have the call anyhow.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/14.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/15.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/16.png" >
        </div>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/17.png" >
        </div>

        <p>Thankfully Frank's mic worked! We hopped on a call, and I asked him a few questions about himself. He got disconnected, but ultimately told me he lived in Miami and studied Art History before he became a journalist.</p>

        <p>He offered to help me troubleshoot the discord verification, but I wanted to get down to business and talk about my big article in The Block! He eventually agreed, and I asked him what he thought about my work. He had some trouble answering and said he wasn't good with words...</p>

        <p>This was a little strange coming from a journalist, but I let it slide! I asked him some more pointed questions, and he got a little defensive. He said that ultimately art is a very subjective experience, so it's difficult to fully capture what he feels in words.</p>

        <p>We talked a bit more about the subjectivity of art, and he offered again to help me troubleshoot discord if I just screenshared. But I was having some trouble with my Chrome screensharing permissions and wanted to keep the conversation going while we were on a roll.</p>

        <p>I asked what his favorite piece of art was, and he said the Mona Lisa (because of the technique and the composition). I could tell he was an art major! He also said his favorite crypto art was CryptoDickButts because they were so unique.</p>

        <p>At this point Frank seemed sort of resigned for some reason, and asked me to describe my art. I told him about how I draw a lot of inspiration from scams -- particularly in how they construct false realities that mirror the false realities that we encounter in our everyday life.</p>

        <p>He asked it scams could be art since they're unethical, to which I replied yes. He disagreed, but said there are a lot of scams in crypto. I asked him if he knew of any good ones, and he described one he heard of where a fake discord verification hijacks your account.</p>

        <p>I asked why someone would want to hijack my account, and he suspected maybe it was to peak it my messages or something. Sounds mostly harmless to me. It seems like <a href="https://twitter.com/lukenamop/status/1496306927969705992" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the attack that he was describing.</p>

        <p>Then he suggested that maybe we collaborate on a project. Maybe since I like scams and money so much, that we could try to sell fake money... to which I responded that that sounds like a great idea! That's right up my alley and can be a new and exciting direction for my art.</p>

        <p>Long story short, he's coming up to Brooklyn for a business meeting, but wants me to pay for his plane ticket since he's short on cash. I told him that he should buy some FastCash if he wants to make some cash fast.</p>

        <p>After our call it seems like he ran into a bit of trouble. He pinged me, but stopped responding to my attempts to help him troubleshoot.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./the-block/18.png" >
        </div>

        <p>It was great talking to you fintechfrank! I'm looking forward to seeing my big article in The Block!</p>
